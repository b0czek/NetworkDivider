### Project I use as a playground for learning new technologies for me by implementing them there.

Build a container with `docker build -t b0czek/network-divider .` or pull it from `b0czek/network-divider`. 


Run it with `docker run -it -p 8080:80 --name network-divider b0czek/network-divider:latest`.
